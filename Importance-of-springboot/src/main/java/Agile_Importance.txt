1) Breafly explain what scrum is?
   -> * Scrum is a agile software development model or framework that follows the iterative or incremental approach
        so that we can get quick feedback and adopt to the changing markets or customer needs. 
      * In Scrun we work in sprint, it is time box development effort it can be 1,2,3,4 weeks 1 week sprints are
        very rare. We are various ceromoneys or meeting in scrum write at the beginning of the sprint, sprint
        planning or meeting where we pull the work for that sprint from the product backlog into the sprint backlog
        within assign this work to developers, testers and other members as this work gets done.
      * we have other ceromoney every day call a stand-up meeting where in discuss the progress 
      * At the end of the sprint will demonstrate the all the work that is done to the product owners or the 
        customers to get the approval.
      * And also sprint Retrospective meeting at the end of every sprint to see what went well in the privous spring
        and what did't go well, and what can be improved which is very key feature of any agile development framework
        or model 
        
2) What are the Roles and responsibilities on a scrum team?
   -> * It all starts with the product owner then have architecture, developers, testers, the scrum master and some 
        cases will have the Devops engineer on the team.
      * A product owner one who interacts with the customer and he comes up with the requirements the rest of the team
        to work on it.
      * The developers, testers and the architects work closly with the owner in understanding the requirements and 
        delevering the product.
      * The architects ensure that the application architecture impact and the deliver the non functional requirements
        such as scalibility, security, deployment etc.
      * Also ensure that the developers and testers are following the industry standards and guidlines.
      * Developers work closly with the product owner, understanding the requirement and with the architects to 
        implements the requirements in the right way as the develop the product.
      * Once the developer develop the feature, they will deliver to the testers who is responsible for the QA
      * Testers again work closely with the product owner to understand the requirement and get the acceptance
        criteria as per the product owner and the test the application deliver as per those requirements.
        They also work closely with the architects to automate the testing process by following the guidelines.
      * Scrun master who is the key on every scrum team, here ensures that all the ceramonies like planning, standup 
        meetings, retrospective meeting are done correctly and also if the developers, testers are the architects
        any impedments or roadblocks with other teams he will ensore that and resolved.
        * Also defend the team, if any destractions caused by other teams in the company.
      * Devops teams which is optionally, developers, testers, and architects usually works with the devops team, which 
        will have their own team to get our feature or product to the production. 
              
3) What is sprint planning?
   -> * It happens at the beginning of the new sprint or in between two sprints we are the team 
        scrum master, architects, developers and testers meet with the product owner and pull the stories to 
        works in that sprint. So we come up with the spring backlog, the developers, QAs and other team members will then 
        pull the they want to work on.
      * The product owner and the scrun master ensure that everybody on the team as enif work for that sprint and then
        will able to deliver whatever we promised in the sprint backlog.
        
4) What is a standup meeting?
   -> A standup also known as scrum meeting or just scrum happens 	everyday tipically in the morning, where all team
      members architects, developers, QAs will meet and share the status of their current work, that is the stories
      they are working on.
      A tipically use 3 sentenses  
      1) What they have done the previous day
      2) What they will working on today and 
      3) If they have any impedements they will state them as well, that is roadblocks to their work then other 
         teams are help them to roadblocks and scrum master can get them resolved after the standup meeting.
      A stand-up meetings are sort typically 5-10 min where each person talks not more than a 10 mins but some
      times it might go longer, that is where the scrum master comes in and ensure that they are sort to the point
      and if they anything else that as to taken up he will say take it offline after the meeting.
      The product owners typically says out of the scrum meeting, once in a while just see how things are going within the 
      sprint and if we are on track.
      The advantages of the stand-up meetings is to know how things are moving within a sprint and there are any
      roadblocks resolve them right away and if there are any issue we learn from them and move on its the key in agile
      software development.
      
5) What is the Sprint Retrospective meeting?
   -> This meeting is happens for the end of each sprint where the entire team meet its usually without the management
      that we can talk and share our thoughts freely and discuss 3 important things are:
      1) What went well in the previous sprint.
      2) What didt go well as aspected.
      3) Insights for the future both from what went well and what didt go as aspected.
         Track should not repeat.
